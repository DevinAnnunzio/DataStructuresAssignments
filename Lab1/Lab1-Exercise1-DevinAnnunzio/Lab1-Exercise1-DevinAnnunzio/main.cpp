 Assignment: Lab 1 Exercise 1
 */

/*Exercise 1: The purpose of this lab is to reinforce writing and calling functions in C++. Specifically, you need to construct a function that has 2 integer arguments and returns whether the first argument is a multiple of the second. The "main" function needs to test this function by using test cases which represent all possible behaviors of the function. You need to use good design principles including the preconditions and postconditions used by the author.*/

/*pre condition - a and b have to be an integer*/

/*post condition - it returns true if the value if a is a multiple of b.*/

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace iostream;
using namespace std;
int a =8;
int b=2;
int *m=&a;
int *n = nb;
std::*m +=b;
std::*n = *m +b;
std::cout <<a <<""<<b;
